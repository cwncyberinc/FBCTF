The FBCTF uses two types of problems to test participants; quiz questions and flags.

Quiz questions are trivia questions related to computer security. Answers or solutions are whitespace and case insensitive and can usually be found with a little research.

Flags are problems that you need to exploit or break. The end goal of a flag question is to recover a "flag" that you can submit for points. All flags will be in the format `flag{some_text_here}`. Any problem that does not use this flag format should explicitly specify so in the description. In a typical flag problem, you may be provided with the URL of a website that you must hack or of a service that you need to connect to using `netcat`. The goal of these challenges can range from dumping the flag from a database on the system, getting a shell on the system, or simply tricking the application to display the flag. The source code for these challenges may or may not be provided.

The FBCTF platform also allows for hints, which may be provided by the organizer. In some cases, hints will be in the problem description. In other cases, you will see a hint button below the challenge. If there is no hint penalty, clicking on the hint button will display the hint. If there is a penalty, the penalty will be displayed on the button, and you can pay the penalty to access the hint, if you have enough points to do so.

For samples of challenges and quizzes, please see the [demo_levels] (https://github.com/facebook/fbctf/tree/master/demo_levels) file in this repository.
