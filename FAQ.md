## What is a CTF? 

CTF, which stands for “Capture the Flag,” is a computer-based competition used to teach information security skills through hands-on experience. Players earn points and gain control of the game map by completing tasks with their team that identify potential threats and secure computers and networks against virtual attacks. Because learning attack techniques is often the best way to learn how to protect against them, CTFs teach both defense and offense skills. Points are awarded to teams on the basis of speed and accuracy. At the end of the allotted time, the team with the most points is declared the winner.

## Why did Facebook create this? 

The current demand for information security talent far outweighs the supply of qualified candidates. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts more than two thirds of the 1.4 million security jobs needed by 2020 will go unfilled due to the insufficient pool of college graduates with the necessary experience and skill. Much of this is due to the lack of exposure students receive to computer science and security principles until they reach college.  

CTFs are a proven resource for teaching and demonstrating practical application of security concepts students learn in the classroom. Across the world, many students already participate in similar competitions, but the barrier of entry remains far too high for most educational organizations to run their own programs. By providing an Open Source resource for all to leverage, Facebook is making it easier for these organizations to teach security skills to students in a safe, legal, and meaningful way. 

## Who can use the Facebook CTF?

Facebook CTF retains a Creative Commons (CC) License, which means it can be used by any non-commercial entity for educational purposes. The platform was built with education and competition organizers in mind. Dozens of high school and college-level student clubs, national competition organizations, educational institutions, and industry groups have already run successful competitions using the Facebook CTF platform. 

The difficulty of any the game depends entirely on the challenges chosen by the organizer. The user experiences was designed to be easy enough for anyone to use. Facebook has hosted CTFs across all age and skill levels from middle school to advanced security engineers. 

## How do I use Facebook's CTF?

* Organize a competition. This can be with as few as two participants and up to several thousand. Players can participate in-person, online, or a combination of the two. 
* Follow the setup instructions in GitHub repo to spin up the platform infrastructure. 
* Enter challenges into Admin Panel
* Register participants in teams
* Hack away!

## How do I access the private repo of challenges? 

To make hosting CTFs as easy as possible, we've released a small private repository of challenges used at previous events as well as those submitted by outside contributors. This repo includes challenges on reverse-engineering, forensics, web application security, cryptology, and basic system administration, all focused primarily on collegiate competitors. If you’re an organizer and would like access to this repo, please email ctf@fb.com with your Github username and background on the event.
